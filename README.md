> "Hey! You there! Yes you, Berkelian! Would you like to know a secret?"

An old school text adventure perfect for college students--especially those attending UC Berkeley. Play for a while and get a feel of what it's like to be a student in Berkeley... with a little extra adventure.

## Controls

There are four buttons. You press them. Here are the specifics:

- Backtrack: Go back in time. The situation might be the "same", but you will have a different action available. Or the situation might completely change. Maybe you'll go back a little _too_ far.
- Advance: Go to the future. Skip events. This can get you out of sticky situations or land you in another one. You might have some unexpected items in your inventory.
- Action: A verb that makes you do a thing. Don't think I need to be more specific.
- Bookbag: View your stuff. Some of it might be useful.

## Items

It's quite simple. There are regular items and there are treasures. Different items help in different situations. You somehow have enough strength to lug it all around in your bookbag.

## Current status

This game is currently in the early stages of development in terms of both story and code. I just like to git add commit and push a lot more than I should. Join me if you'd like! Just keep in mind that I'm a complete novice at this and be nice.
